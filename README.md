Oriented JS or Ojs is meant to make javascript a little more structured like traditional Java.
Ojs gives developers the ability to declare interfaces and abstract classes as well as implement 
 and extend them respectively. Hopefully this will help make more readable and allow developer to 
 implement design patterns in traditional ways. 
 
 Please understand that Javascript doesnt lend itself to this kind of structure so i am sure there are ways to 
 circumvent my methods and structure, but it this plugin is an attempt to introduce something familiar.
 
 So drink up and try Ojs :) 



## Quick start

For the time being please download this repo and try out the demo.
The script that contains the magic is oriented.js.

It isn't tested so don't go putting it in production code just yet.


## Features

* Create and Declare Interfaces
* Create and extend Abstract Classes
* Define "Abstract methods"



## Documentation

Look at the comments in main.js. It should be very self explanatory
